# A study of two different quantum mechanical systems

Both systems are described by the Schr√∂dinger equation with a one-dimensional potential. 
  - The first system is the simple and well-known particle in a box. 
  - The second problem describes a particle in a box with a potential barrier.

# Contents
The easiest way to run the main program is to "stay" in the directory where the Makefile for compiling the main program is.
 -  Compile the program
 -  Run main.out with input parameters <number of discretization steps, initial condition, potential>
    - ./main.out 1000 first_eigenmode, barrier
