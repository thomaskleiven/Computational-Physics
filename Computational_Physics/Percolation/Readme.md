# A small study of percolation theory

A Monte Carlo simulation looking at the study of the formation of clustersing a graph.

**Short summary**

In this simulation I look at three different graphs, namely a square, triangular and a hexagonal graph in order to
estimate some of the universal critical exponents in the context of perculation theory.
